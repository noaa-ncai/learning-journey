## Exploring Machine Learning with ENSO and Seasonal Forecasting

In this notebook, we explore the NOAA NCEI Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) V5 dataset hosted by the NOAA Physical Systems Laboratory and Nino3.4 indices from the National Centers for Environmental Information with the Python programing language as a building block for basic machine learning vocabulary and principles.

Through working through this notebook, you should have a basic:
-  Understanding of the lexicon for traditional machine learning
-  Familiarity with validation metrics like Pearson's correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error to evaluate a machine learning model's performance
-  Background in identifying overfitting and underfitting
