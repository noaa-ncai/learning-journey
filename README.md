# NOAA Center for Artificial Intelligence Learning Journey Library

NOAA Center for Artificial Intelligence (NCAI) is building a clearinghouse of open-science resources centered around artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for NOAA and the public that leverages standard development environments. Our goal is to provide a library to search, discover, and tailor accessible knowledge. From tutorials to best practices, we aspire to offer materials, training, and ideas.

## Learning Journey Library
The purpose of this Learning Journey library is to provide curated community-generated educational interactive learning materials. Learning Journeys are short instructional modules that match any user’s or interested learner’s needs and skill levels. The goal is to promote environmental data science, expand AI and machine learning knowledge at all levels of understanding, and improve access to NOAA data and products [^1], achieving the principle recommendations from NCAI’s 2021 Training Gap Assessment [^2].

## Learning Journey Concept
Interactive notebook technology (e.g., Jupyter and RMarkdown notebooks) allows users to set their engagement level with material from either casually reading to understand how NOAA is leveraging AI/ML to tinkering to probe NOAA’s AI models and benchmarks. Notebooks comprise the building blocks of a Learning Journey. While NCAI may suggest certain pathways across multiple notebooks to constitute a Learning Journey, the modularization allows individuals engaging with the material to chart their own Learning Journey across the Center’s notebooks. Each notebook outlines prerequisites for engaging with the material and expected learning outcomes to allow users to decide if the material is right for them.

## Contributing to the Learning Journey Library
Presently, contributions hosted by NCAI are limited to NOAA-centric projects to highlight AI/ML best practices and success stories. The tools used to curate notebooks are publically available to generate similarly structured material to benefit the broader Earth and environmental science community. Broad community adoption allows for a broader cross listing of community-centric learning resources.
