## NOAA MagNet: Model the Geomagnetic Field Challenge

The goal of the notebooks in this folder is to share experiences from the [NOAA MagNet](https://ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/mag-net-challenge.html) model the geomagnetic field challenge.

Today there are two notebooks and we anticipate adding additional notebooks at a later date.

* <b>Chapter 1 "Develop the LSTM Model"</b> (magnet_lstm_tutorial_chapter1_model_devel.ipynb)
    * This notebook provides the benchmark machine learning modeling experience for a key space weather storm indicator, the disturbance-storm-time (<i>Dst</i>) index, for the 2020 NOAA competition, "MagNet: Model the Geomagnetic Field".
* <b>Chapter 2 "Explainable AI (XAI)"</b> (magnet_lstm_tutorial_chapter2_xai.ipynb)
    * This chapter focuses on evaluating the benchmark model developed in <b>Chapter 1</b> for predicting the disturbance-storm-time (<i>Dst</i>) index space weather storm indicator.
